Nice use of initializing with params
Nice use of inheritance
'~~*' -- Impressive!
Used build entity methods within repos - good thinking
Save artist - nicely set up so that when a song is saved with a new artist it will add the artist to the database instead of returning an error
Initialize with .fetch = +++
@artists = params[:artists] || [] ....good stuff
Is every method tested?
Great UI
Nice use of layout.erb
